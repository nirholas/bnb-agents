# MCP Servers Guide

How to set up and use the 6 Model Context Protocol servers — the core technology that connects AI to blockchains.

> **New to MCP?** Don't worry — this guide explains everything from scratch. Also see the [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) for term definitions.

## What Is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard (created by Anthropic) that lets AI assistants connect to external tools and data sources.

**The simplest way to understand MCP:** Without MCP, AI can only *talk about* crypto. With MCP, AI can *interact with* crypto.

| Without MCP | With MCP |
|------------|---------|
| "BNB is probably around $600" | "BNB is exactly $623.47 right now" |
| "You could try swapping on PancakeSwap" | *Actually executes the swap for you* |
| "I can't check your wallet" | "Your wallet has 1.5 BNB and 4 tokens" |

Think of MCP like **USB for AI** — a universal way to plug in new capabilities. Each MCP server exposes "tools" (individual actions the AI can call), and any MCP-compatible AI client can use them.

### How MCP Works (Simplified)

```
 You ask Claude a question
        │
        ▼
 Claude recognizes it needs real data
        │
        ▼
 Claude calls an MCP tool (e.g., "get_balance")
        │
        ▼
 The MCP server handles the request
   (talks to the blockchain, exchange, or API)
        │
        ▼
 Server returns the data to Claude
        │
        ▼
 Claude uses the data to answer you in plain English
```

This all happens in about 1-2 seconds, completely automatically.

### Which AI Assistants Support MCP?

| Assistant | MCP Support | Notes |
|-----------|:-----------:|-------|
| Claude Desktop | ✅ | First-class support |
| Claude Code | ✅ | CLI-based |
| GitHub Copilot | ✅ | Via extensions |
| Cursor | ✅ | Built-in |
| Windsurf | ✅ | Built-in |
| ChatGPT | ❌ | Not yet — use as API with wrapper |
| Any MCP client | ✅ | The protocol is open standard |

## Quick Setup

All MCP servers follow the same pattern:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the server
cd mcp-servers/<server-name>

# 2. Install dependencies
bun install    # or npm install

# 3. Build (if needed)
bun run build  # or npm run build

# 4. Start the server
bun start      # or npm start
```

Then add it to your AI assistant's config (details for each server below).

> **Which server should I start with?** If you're on BNB Chain, start with **BNB Chain MCP** (#1 below). If you trade on Binance.com, start with **Binance MCP** (#2). If you work across many chains, try **Universal Crypto MCP** (#4).

### 6. UCAI (ABI-to-MCP Generator)

**Location:** `mcp-servers/ucai/`
**Best for:** Converting any smart contract into an MCP server

#### What It Does

Takes a smart contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface) and automatically generates an MCP server that exposes every contract function as a tool.

```bash
# Install
pip install ucai

# Generate an MCP server from a contract ABI
ucai generate --abi ./MyContract.json --chain bsc --output ./my-mcp-server

# Start the generated server
cd my-mcp-server && python server.py
```

This means you can turn **any** deployed smart contract into an AI-accessible tool in seconds.

---

## Using Multiple Servers Together

You can run multiple MCP servers simultaneously:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bnbchain": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nirholas/bnbchain-mcp"],
      "env": { "BSC_RPC_URL": "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org" }
    },
    "binance": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nirholas/binance-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BINANCE_API_KEY": "your-key",
        "BINANCE_SECRET_KEY": "your-secret"
      }
    },
    "market-data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nirholas/crypto-market-data"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now Claude can query BNB Chain, trade on Binance, and fetch market data — all in one conversation.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys or private keys** to your repository
2. Use **read-only API keys** when you don't need trading
3. Set **IP restrictions** on your Binance API keys
4. Use **testnet** for development (`BSC_TESTNET_RPC_URL`)
5. Start with **small amounts** when testing live trading
6. Review the [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md) for more

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Connection refused" | Make sure the server is running (`bun start`) |
| "Invalid API key" | Check your environment variables are set correctly |
| "Rate limited" | Add delays between requests, or upgrade your API plan |
| "Transaction failed" | Check gas settings and wallet balance |
| Server crash on start | Run `bun install` first, check Node.js version (18+) |
