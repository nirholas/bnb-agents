## 🗺️ Choose Your Path

### 🌱 "I'm completely new to crypto and/or AI"

You're in the right place. Start here, in this order:

1. **[What Is This?](what-is-this.md)** — Plain-English explanation, no jargon, no assumptions
2. **[Glossary](GLOSSARY.md)** — Every term you'll encounter, explained simply
3. **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** — From zero to running in 10 minutes
4. **[FAQ](faq.md)** — Common questions answered honestly

### 🔧 "I'm a developer who wants to build with this"

You'll want to understand the system, then set up the pieces you need:

1. **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** — Install, build, and verify
2. **[Architecture](architecture.md)** — How everything fits together (with diagrams)
3. **[MCP Servers](mcp-servers.md)** — Connect AI to blockchains (the core feature)
4. **[Agents](agents.md)** — All 78 agents, how to use them, how to create your own
5. **[Examples](examples.md)** — Real-world code patterns (beginner → advanced)
