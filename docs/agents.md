# AI Agents Guide

Everything you need to know about the 78 AI agents — what they are, how to use them, and how to create your own.

> **New here?** An AI agent is just a set of instructions (a "personality") that makes a general-purpose AI act like a domain expert. No coding required to use them. See the [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) for term definitions.

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are pre-configured personality definitions for AI assistants. Each agent is a JSON file that contains:

- **A specific role** — What it specializes in (trading, analysis, staking, etc.)
- **System prompt** — Instructions that shape how the AI behaves and what it knows
- **Tool access** — Which MCP tools it can use for real-time data
- **Knowledge** — Domain-specific context and expertise
- **Opening questions** — Suggested first questions to ask the agent

You load an agent into your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.), and it becomes a specialist in that domain.

**Analogy:** Loading an agent is like handing an expert a role card before a conversation. The expert (your AI) reads the card and acts accordingly — bringing the right knowledge, using the right tools, and giving domain-specific answers.

### What Agents Can NOT Do

- Agents don't *run* code — they're inert JSON text
- Agents don't access your wallet or keys — they need an MCP server for that
- Agents aren't magic — they improve AI accuracy in their domain but don't guarantee correct answers
- Agents don't learn between sessions — each conversation starts fresh

## How to Use an Agent

There are three ways to use agents, from simplest to most technical.

### Option 1: With Claude Desktop (Recommended for Beginners)

This is the easiest approach. No coding needed.

1. **Choose an agent** from the lists above
2. **Find the agent file** — e.g., `agents/bnb-chain-agents/pancakeswap-trader.json`
3. **Open the file** and copy the `systemRole` field (the long text string)
4. **In Claude Desktop**, create a new Project → click "Instructions" → paste the text
5. **Start chatting** — Claude now behaves like that agent

**What a conversation looks like with the PancakeSwap Trader agent loaded:**

> **You:** I want to swap 0.5 BNB for CAKE. What's the best route?
>
> **Claude (as PancakeSwap Trader):** Let me check the current rates on PancakeSwap v3.
>
> Based on current pricing:
> - **Direct route:** 0.5 BNB → ~12.3 CAKE (via BNB/CAKE pool)
> - **Split route:** 0.5 BNB → USDT → CAKE gives ~12.1 CAKE (slightly worse due to two swaps)
>
> I recommend the direct route. The BNB/CAKE v3 pool has $45M TVL and tight spreads. With 0.5% slippage tolerance, your minimum output would be ~12.24 CAKE.
>
> Want me to execute the swap?

### Option 2: With Any AI Platform

The `systemRole` field in each agent JSON works with any AI platform:

```json
{
  "identifier": "pancakeswap-trader",
  "meta": {
    "title": "PancakeSwap Trader",
    "description": "Expert DEX trading agent for PancakeSwap v3"
  },
  "systemRole": "You are a PancakeSwap trading expert..."
}
```

Copy the `systemRole` value and use it as a system prompt in:
- ChatGPT (Custom Instructions)
- Claude (Projects → Instructions)
- Gemini
- Any LLM API

### Option 3: Via the JSON API

After running `bun run build`, all agents are available at `public/index.json`:

```bash
# Get all agents
cat public/index.json | jq '.agents | length'  # → 78

# Find a specific agent
cat public/index.json | jq '.agents[] | select(.identifier == "pancakeswap-trader")'
```

---

## Agent JSON Format

Every agent follows this schema:

```json
{
  "identifier": "unique-agent-id",
  "author": "nirholas",
  "createdAt": "2025-12-21",
  "meta": {
    "title": "Agent Display Name",
    "description": "One-line description",
    "tags": ["defi", "trading", "bnb"],
    "avatar": "🥞",
    "category": "trading"
  },
  "config": {
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "maxTokens": 4096
  },
  "systemRole": "You are a specialized AI agent that..."
}
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `identifier` | string | Unique ID (kebab-case) |
| `meta.title` | string | Display name |
| `meta.description` | string | Short description |
| `systemRole` | string | The agent's personality and expertise |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `meta.tags` | string[] | Searchable tags |
| `meta.avatar` | string | Emoji avatar |
| `meta.category` | string | Category for grouping |
| `config.model` | string | Preferred LLM model |
| `config.temperature` | number | Creativity (0-1) |

## Creating Your Own Agent

### Step 1: Copy the Template

```bash
cp agents/bnb-chain-agents/agent-template.json agents/bnb-chain-agents/my-agent.json
```

### Step 2: Edit the Definition

```json
{
  "identifier": "my-custom-agent",
  "meta": {
    "title": "My Custom Agent",
    "description": "A specialized agent for my use case",
    "tags": ["custom", "bnb"],
    "avatar": "🤖"
  },
  "systemRole": "You are an expert in [your domain]. You help users with [specific tasks]. You always [key behaviors]."
}
```

### Step 3: Rebuild the Index

```bash
bun run build
```

### Tips for Good System Prompts

1. **Be specific** — "You are a PancakeSwap v3 liquidity expert" beats "You know about DeFi"
2. **Define boundaries** — Tell the agent what it should NOT do
3. **Include context** — Reference specific protocols, contracts, or APIs
4. **Set tone** — Professional? Casual? Technical? Define it
5. **Add safety rails** — "Always warn about risks before recommending trades"

## Understanding Agent + MCP Server Combos

Agents provide expertise, but they need MCP servers to access real data. Here are the most powerful combinations:

| Agent | + MCP Server | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| PancakeSwap Trader | BNB Chain MCP | AI can quote and execute real DEX trades |
| Binance Futures Expert | Binance MCP | AI can place and manage futures positions |
| Portfolio Tracker | Universal Crypto MCP | AI tracks holdings across 60+ chains |
| Security Auditor | BNB Chain MCP | AI can read contract code and check on-chain data |
| BNB Chain News Alpha | Crypto News MCP | AI cross-references news with on-chain activity |

> **Without an MCP server:** The agent gives theoretical advice based on its training data.
> **With an MCP server:** The agent can look up real-time data, verify claims, and execute actions.
